# Curiosity

A collection of short programs written to get some insights.

## 1. pipe\_read\_write.cpp

Found out that a process can write something and then read the same from a pipe.

## 2. sizeof.c

When is sizeof computed - compile time or runtime? What about VLAs?

## 3. branch\_prediction.cpp

Demonstrates performance penalty for bad branch prediction.
